With this Libary you can declare lots of pinns with only one funktion (see example code)
Declare a start and stop pin and evrythin in between will be defined as an in or output
for example:

start: 3
stop: 10

pinns 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 are now deklared an an output

This projekt is still in an experimental phase bug fixes and more features (like input funktions)
will come soon.

DISCLAIMER: This code works only with the arduino uno i'll give support for other board in the future.
